# üîç IP address purity check tool

based on Cloudflare Worker deployment, supports ProxyCheck.io professional detection algorithm, and provides complete subscription link management and automated detection functions.

## üöÄ One-click deployment

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/twj0/ip-address-purity-checker)

Click the button above and the deployment can be completed within a few minutes!


## üõ†Ô∏è Manual deployment

If you wish to deploy manually or customize the configuration:

### Step 1: Prepare the environment
```bash
npm install -g wrangler

wrangler --version
```

### Step 2: Log in to Cloudflare
```bash
wrangler login

wrangler whoami
```

### Step 3: Cloning and Deployment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/twj0/ip-address-purity-checker.git

cd ip-address-purity-checker

wrangler deploy

wrangler tail
```

### Step 4: Configure KV storage (optional)
```bash

wrangler kv namespace create "IP_CACHE"
# Copy the returned ID and update the KV configuration in wrangler.toml
wrangler deploy
```

> **Note**: KV storage is optional. Worker works fine without KV storage, but it cannot save detection history and subscription data.
